# Asynchronous Programming & Promises

This repository contains TypeScript functions that demonstrate the use of async/await, Promises, and setTimeout.

---

## Questions

1. **Question 1:** Write a TypeScript function that uses async/await to wait for 2 seconds and then returns a string "Hello World".
2. **Question 2:** Create a TypeScript function that takes a callback function as an argument and uses setTimeout to call the callback after 1 second.
3. **Question 3:** Write a TypeScript function that returns a Promise that resolves with the value "Resolved!" after 3 seconds.
4. **Question 4:** Create a TypeScript function that uses async/await to wait for two Promises to resolve and then returns their results as an array.
5. **Question 5:** Write a TypeScript function that uses async/await to wait for a Promise to resolve and then logs the result to the console.
6. **Question 6:** Write a TypeScript function that uses async/await to wait for a Promise to reject and then logs the error to the console.
7. **Question 7:** Create a TypeScript function that takes a number as an argument and returns a Promise that resolves with the square of the number after a delay of 1 second.
8. **Question 8:** Write a TypeScript function that uses async/await to wait for an array of Promises to resolve and then returns an array of their results.
9. **Question 9:** Create a TypeScript function that uses setTimeout to call a function repeatedly every 2 seconds.
10. **Question 10:** Write a TypeScript function that uses async/await to wait for a Promise to resolve and then returns a new Promise that resolves with the result multiplied by 2.

## Async/Await with setTimeout

This function uses `async/await` to wait for 2 seconds using `setTimeout` and then returns the string "Hello World".

---

## Using setTimeout with Callback

This function takes a callback function as an argument and uses `setTimeout` to call the callback after 1 second.

---

## Promise Resolving after Delay

This function returns a Promise that resolves with the value "Resolved!" after 3 seconds using `setTimeout`.

---

## Async/Await with Promise.all

This function uses `async/await` to wait for two Promises to resolve using `Promise.all` and then returns their results as an array.

---

## Logging Promise Result with Async/Await

This function uses `async/await` to wait for a Promise to resolve and then logs the result to the console.

---

## Handling Promise Rejection with Async/Await

This function uses `async/await` to wait for a Promise to reject and then logs the error to the console.

---

## Returning Promise with Delayed Square Calculation

This function takes a number as an argument and returns a Promise that resolves with the square of the number after a delay of 1 second using `setTimeout`.

---

## Async/Await with Array of Promises

This function uses `async/await` to wait for an array of Promises to resolve and then returns an array of their results.

---

## Repeated Function Call with setTimeout

This function uses `setTimeout` to call a function repeatedly every 2 seconds.

---

## Async/Await with Promise Result Multiplication

This function uses `async/await` to wait for a Promise to resolve and then returns a new Promise that resolves with the result multiplied by 2.
